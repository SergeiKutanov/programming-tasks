 * A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular
 * web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width
 * W satisfy the following requirements:
 *
 * The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
 * The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 * The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
 * Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.
